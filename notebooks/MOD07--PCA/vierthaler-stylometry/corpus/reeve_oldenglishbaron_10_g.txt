 thank you, and I will embrace your kind offer; I will be
your tenant for the present; my castle in Wales shall be put in repair,
in the meantime; if I do not reside there, it will be an establishment
for one of my younger sons.”

“But what will you do with your old soldiers and dependants?”

“My lord, I will never cast them off. There is another house on my
estate that has been shut up many years; I will have it repaired and
furnished properly for the reception of my old men: I will endow it with
a certain sum to be paid annually, and will appoint a steward to
manage their revenue; I will continue it during the lives of the first
inhabitants, and after that I shall leave it to my son here, to do as he
pleases.”

“Your son,” said Edmund, “will make it the business of his life to act
worthy of such a father.”

“Enough,” said Sir Philip, “I am satisfied that you will. I purpose to
reside myself in that very apartment which my dear friend your father
inhabited; I will tread in his footsteps, and think he sees me acting
his part in his son’s family. I will be attended by my own servants;
and, whenever you desire it, I will give you my company; your joys, your
griefs shall be mine; I shall hold your children in my arms, and their
prattle shall amuse my old age; and, as my last earthly wish, your hands
shall close my eyes.”

“Long, very long,” said Edmund, with eyes and hands lifted up, “may it
be ere I perform so sad a duty!”

“Long and happily may you live together!” said the Baron; “I will hope
to see you sometimes, and to claim a share in your blessings. But let
us give no more tears to sorrow, the rest shall be those of joy and
transport. The first step we take shall be to marry our Edmund; I will
give orders for the celebration, and they shall be the last orders I
shall give in this house.” They then separated, and went to prepare for
the approaching solemnity.

Sir Philip and the Baron had a private conference concerning Edmund’s
assuming the name and title of Lovel. “I am resolved,” said Sir Philip,
“to go to the king; to acquaint him briefly with Edmund’s history; I
will request that he may be called up to parliament by a writ, for there
is no need of a new patent, he being the true inheritor; in the mean
time he shall assume the name, arms, and title, and I will answer any
one that shall dispute his right to them.[”] Sir Philip then declared
his resolution to set out with the Baron at his departure, and to settle
all his other affairs before he returned to take up his residence at the
Castle.

A few days after, the marriage was celebrated, to the entire
satisfaction of all parties. The Baron ordered the doors to be thrown
open, and the house free for all comers; with every other token of joy
and festivity. Edmund appeared full of joy without levity, of mirth
without extravagance; he received the congratulations of his friends,
with ease, freedom, and vivacity. He sent for his foster father and
mother, who began to think themselves neglected, as he had been so
deeply engaged in affairs of more consequence that he had not been
particularly attentive to them; he made them come into the great hall,
and presented them to his lady.

“These,” said he, “are the good people to whom I am, under God, indebted
for my present happiness; they were my first benefactors; I was obliged
to them for food and sustenance in my childhood, and this good woman
nourished my infancy at her own breast.” The lady received them
graciously, and saluted Margery. Andrew kneeled down, and, with great
humility, begged Edmund’s pardon for his treatment of him in his
childhood. “I heartily forgive you,” said he, “and I will excuse you to
yourself; it was natural for you to look upon me as an intruder that
was eating your children’s bread; you saved my life, and afterwards
you sustained it by your food and raiment: I ought to have maintained
myself, and to have contributed to your maintenance. But besides this,
your treatment of me was the first of my preferment; it recommended
me to the notice of this noble family. Everything that happened to me
since, has been a step to my present state of honour and happiness.
Never man had so many benefactors as myself; but both they, and myself,
have been only instruments in the hands of Providence, to bring about
its own purposes; let us praise God for all! I shared your poverty, and
you will share my riches; I will give you the cottage where you dwell,
and the ground about it; I will also pay you the annual sum of ten
pounds for the lives of you both; I will put out your children to manual
trades, and assist you to provide for them in their own station; and you
are to look upon this as paying a debt, and not bestowing a gift; I owe
you more than I can ever pay; and, if there be any thing further in my
power that will contribute to your happiness, you can ask nothing in
reason that I will deny you.”

Andrew hid his face; “I cannot bear it!” said he; “oh what a brute was
I, to abuse such a child as this! I shall never forgive myself!”

“You must indeed, my friend; for I forgive and thank you.”

Andrew retired back, but Margery came forward; she looked earnestly on
Edmund, she then threw her arms about his neck, and wept aloud.

“My precious child! my lovely babe! thank God, I have lived to see this
day! I will rejoice in your good fortune, and your bounty to us, but
I must ask one more favour yet; that I may sometimes come hither and
behold that gracious countenance, and thank God that I was honoured so
far as to give thee food from my own breast, and to bring thee up to be
a blessing to me, and to all that know thee!”

Edmund was affected, he returned her embrace; he bade her come to the
Castle as often as she pleased, and she should always be received as his
mother; the bride saluted her, and told her the oftener she came, the
more welcome she should be.

Margery and her husband retired, full of blessings and prayers for their
happiness; she gave vent to her joy, by relating to the servants and
neighbours every circumstance of Edmund’s birth, infancy, and childhood.
Many a tear was dropped by the auditors, and many a prayer wafted to
Heaven for his happiness. Joseph took up the story where she left it:
he told the rising dawn of youth and virtue, darting its ray through the
clouds of obscurity, and how every stroke of envy and malignity brushed
away some part of the darkness that veiled its lustre. He told the story
of the haunted apartment, and all the consequences of it; how he and
Oswald conveyed the youth away from the Castle, no more to return till
he came as master of it. He closed the tale with praise to Heaven for
the happy discovery, that gave such an heir to the house of Lovel;
to his dependants such a Lord and Master; to mankind a friend and
benefactor. There was truly a house of joy; not that false kind, in
the midst of which there is heaviness, but that of rational creatures,
grateful to the Supreme Benefactor, raising their minds by a due
enjoyment of earthly blessings to a preparation for a more perfect state
hereafter.

A few days after the wedding, the Lord Fitz-Owen began to prepare
for his journey to the north. He gave to Edmund the plate, linen, and
furniture of the Castle, the farming stock and utensils; he would have
added a sum of money, but Sir Philip stopped his hand.

“We do not forget,” said he, “that you have other children, we will not
suffer you to injure them; give us your blessing and paternal affection,
and we have nothing more to ask. I told you, my Lord, that you and I
should one day be sincere friends.”

“We must be so,” answered the Baron; “it is impossible to be long your
enemy. We are brothers, and shall be to our lives’ end.”

They regulated the young man’s household; the Baron gave leave to the
servants to choose their master; the elder ones followed him (except
Joseph, who desired to live with Edmund, as the chief happiness of his
life); most of the younger ones chose the service of the youthful pair.
There was a tender and affectionate parting on all sides. Edmund
besought his beloved William not to leave him. The Baron said, he must
insist on his being at his brother’s wedding, as a due attention to him,
but after that he should return to the Castle for some time.

The Baron and Sir Philip Harclay, with their train, set forward. Sir
Philip went to London and obtained all he desired for his Edmund; from
thence he went into Yorkshire, and settled his affairs there, removing
his pensioners to his other house, and putting Lord Fitz-Owen in
possession of his own. They had a generous contention about the terms;
but Sir Philip insisted on the Baron’s accepting the use of everything
there.

“You hold it in trust for a future grandchild,” said he, “whom I hope to
live to endow with it.”

During Sir Philip’s absence, the young Lord Lovel caused the haunted
apartment to be repaired and furnished for the reception of his father
by adoption. He placed his friend Joseph over all his men-servants,
and ordered him to forbear his attendance; but the old man would always
stand at the side-board, and feast his eyes with the countenance of
his own master’s son, surrounded with honour and happiness. John Wyatt
waited upon the person of his lord, and enjoyed his favour without
abatement. Mr. William Fitz-Owen accompanied Sir Philip Harclay from the
north country, when he returned to take up his residence at the Castle
of Lovel.

Edmund, in the arms of love and friendship, enjoyed with true relish
the blessings that surrounded him, with an heart overflowing with
benevolence to his fellow creatures, and raptures of gratitude to his
Creator. His lady and himself were examples of conjugal affection and
happiness. Within a year from his marriage she brought him a son
and heir, whose birth renewed the joy and congratulations of all his
friends. The Baron Fitz-Owen came to the baptism, and partook of his
children’s blessings. The child was called Arthur, after the name of his
grandfather.

The year following was born a second son, who was called Philip Harclay;
upon him the noble knight of that name settled his estate in Yorkshire;
and by the king’s permission, he took the name and arms of that family.

The third son was called William; he inherited the fortune of his uncle
of that name, who adopted him, and he made the Castle of Lovel his
residence, and died a bachelor.

The fourth son was called Edmund; the fifth Owen; and there was also a
daughter, called Emma.

When time had worn out the prejudices of Sir Robert Fitz-Owen, the good
old Baron of that name proposed a marriage between his eldest son
and heir, and the daughter of Edmund Lord Lovel, which was happily
concluded. The nuptials were honoured with the presence of both
families; and the old Baron was so elevated with this happy union of
his descendants, that he cried out, “Now I am ready to die--I have lived
long enough--this is the band of love that unites all my children to me,
and to each other!” He did not long survive this happy event; he died
full of years and honours, and his name was never mentioned but with
the deepest marks of gratitude, love and veneration. Sweet is the
remembrance of the virtuous, and happy are the descendants of such
a father! they will think on him and emulate his virtues--they will
remember him, and be ashamed to degenerate from their ancestor.

Many years after Sir Philip Harclay settled at the Castle, he received
tidings from his friend Zadisky, by one of the two servants who
attended him to the Holy Land. From him he learned that his friend had
discovered, by private advices, that he had a son living in Palestine,
which was the chief motive of his leaving England; that he had met
with various adventures in pursuit of him; that at length he found
him, converted him to the Christian religion, and then persuaded him
to retire from the world into a monastery by the side of Mount Libanus,
where he intended to end his days.

That Walter, commonly called Lord Lovel, had entered into the service
of the Greek emperor, John Paleologus, not bearing to undergo a life of
solitude and retirement; that he made up a story of his being compelled
to leave his native country by his relations, for having accidentally
killed one of them, and that he was treated with great cruelty and
injustice; that he had accepted a post in the emperor’s army, and was
soon after married to the daughter of one of the chief officers of it.

Zadisky foresaw, and lamented the downfall of that Empire, and withdrew
from the storm he saw approaching. Finally, he bade the messenger tell
Sir Philip Harclay and his adopted son, that he should not cease to pray
for them, and desired their prayers in return.

Sir Philip desired Lord Lovel to entertain this messenger in his
service. That good knight lived to extreme old age in honour and
happiness, and died in the arms of his beloved Edmund, who also
performed the last duties to his faithful Joseph.

Father Oswald lived many years in the family as chaplain; he retired
from thence at length, and died in his own monastery.

Edmund Lord Lovel lived to old age, in peace, honour and happiness; and
died in the arms of his children.

Sir Philip Harclay caused the papers relating to his son’s history to be
collected together; the first part of it was written under his own eye
in Yorkshire, the subsequent parts by Father Oswald at the Castle of
Lovel. All these, when together, furnish a striking lesson to posterity,
of the over-ruling hand of Providence, and the certainty of RETRIBUTION.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
